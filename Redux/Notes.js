what is redux ?

    REDUX is a javaScript applications
    
    -> Redux is not tied to react 
    -> can be used with React, Angular, VUe or Even vanilla js
    -> redux is a library for js applications

    Redux is a state container 

            -> reduc stroes the state of your applications
            -> state of an app os the state represented by all the individual components of that app
            -> Redux will store and manage the application state

    
    Redux is predictable

        predictable in what way ?

        -> Redux is a state container
        -> The state of the application can change 
        ex: todo list app - item (peding) -> item (completed)

        in redux, all state transitions are explicit and it is possible ti keep track of them 
        the changes to ypur application's state become predictable


    why we use Redux ?

            => to avoid prop chaning
            => redux givs the combine feature of useContext and useReducer
