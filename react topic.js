🚀 Phase 1: React Core (Fundamentals + Internal Workings)

How React works under the hood (Virtual DOM, Reconciliation, Fiber)

Components (Functional vs Class)

Props & State (how React tracks them)

Rendering & Re-rendering (why and when)

JSX & React.createElement()

⚙️ Phase 2: React Hooks (Deep Internal Working)

useState (internal state queue)

useEffect (dependency tracking and cleanup)

useRef, useMemo, useCallback (performance optimization)

Custom Hooks

🧠 Phase 3: State Management & Context

Context API (internal working of Provider & Consumer)

Prop drilling problem

useReducer (with examples)

Global state vs local state

🧩 Phase 4: Advanced Concepts

React Fiber (scheduler & concurrent rendering)

Reconciliation Algorithm

React 18 features (Concurrent mode, Suspense, useTransition)

Error boundaries

Performance optimization

🧰 Phase 5: Real-World Practice

Building mini-projects & cloning parts of apps (Amazon, YouTube, etc.)

Debugging & profiling React apps
